This is a simple example to test the range finder class provided by utils/real_robots/sensors/LRF/laserScanner.h.

===Install====
To be able to run this example, the URG library has to be installed first (https://github.com/aldebaran/liburg). Either follow the install
instructions on the page or use the installed package manager to manually search for liburg. You can also run:

	sudo apt-get install liburg0-dev

===Compilation===
Compile the program with the following options:

	-lurg_monitor -lurg -lurg_coordinate -lurg_geometry -lurg_connection -lurg_connection_sdl -lurg_common -lurg_system -lstdc++ -lm
	-Ipath_to_laserScanner.h/

or use the included Makefile.

===Run the example===
First connect the LRF via USB to the PC. Then run the example program with
	
	sudo ./testLRF

The sudo command is necessary to be able to access the USB port.
If the LRF is connected successfully, a file with the current measurement of the LRF should be created (testLRF.dat). 
The file contains the measured ranges from each beam in cm. The first entry was measured by the beam with index 0.
To convert indices to angles, use the functions index2rad(int index) and index2deg(int index).
The current measurement with corresponding beam angles is also printed to console.
You can run the following python program to visualize the measurement:

	python plotLRF.py

NOTE: While acquiring data, the underlying URG driver pauses/blocks the execution of its thread. This means, that calling urg.update() will
      hold the program until the measurement is finished (about 100 ms), if not moved to its own thread. This may or may not be an issue
      depending on the concrete application.
