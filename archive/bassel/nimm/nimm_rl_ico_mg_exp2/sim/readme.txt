results_XX.txt, actor_weights, critic_weights, inputs_log, output_log contain 
the collected data during the learning process.sss

1) results_XXX contains the number of iterations that were needed until the convergence of the actor's policy. Each experiment is repeated for at least 30 times.
2) actor_weights, critic_weights contain the weights' values of the actor and of the critic during learning.
3) inputs_log, output_log contain data about input and output signals after learning.


(These data are shown as figures in Bassel's Master Thesis)
