  abstract = {Neurobiological studies have shown that insects are able to adapt
	leg movements and posture for obstacle negotiation in changing environments.
	Moreover, the distance to an obstacle where an insect begins to climb
	is found to be a major parameter for successful obstacle negotiation.
	Inspired by these findings, we present an adaptive neural control
	mechanism for obstacle negotiation behavior in hexapod robots. It
	combines locomotion control, backbone joint control, local leg reflexes,
	and neural learning. While the first three components generate locomotion
	including walking and climbing, the neural learning mechanism allows
	the robot to adapt its behavior for obstacle negotiation with respect
	to changing conditions, e.g., variable obstacle heights and different
	walking gaits. By successfully learning the association of an early,
	predictive signal (conditioned stimulus, CS) and a late, reflex signal
	(unconditioned stimulus, UCS), both provided by ultrasonic sensors
	at the front of the robot, the robot can autonomously find an appropriate
	distance from an obstacle to initiate climbing. The adaptive neural
	control was developed and tested first on a physical robot simulation,
	and was then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, called
	AMOS II. The results show that the robot can efficiently negotiate
	obstacles with a height up to 85% of the robot's leg length in simulation
	and 75% in a real environment.},

  title = {Neural Control and Adaptive Neural Forward Models for Insect-like,
	Energy-Efficient, and Adaptable Locomotion of Walking Machines},

  number = {12},
  abstract = {Living creatures, like walking animals, have found fascinating solutions
	for the problem of locomotion control. Their movements show the impression
	of elegance including versatile, energy-efficient, and adaptable
	locomotion. During the last few decades, roboticists have tried to
	imitate such natural properties with artificial legged locomotion
	systems by using different approaches including machine learning
	algorithms, classical engineering control techniques, and biologically-inspired
	control mechanisms. However, their levels of performance are still
	far from the natural ones. By contrast, animal locomotion mechanisms
	seem to largely depend not only on central mechanisms (central pattern
	generators, CPGs) and sensory feedback (afferent-based control) but
	also on internal forward models (efference copies). They are used
	to a different degree in different animals. Generally, CPGs organize
	basic rhythmic motions which are shaped by sensory feedback while
	internal models are used for sensory prediction and state estimations.
	According to this concept, we present here adaptive neural locomotion
	control consisting of a CPG mechanism with neuromodulation and local
	leg control mechanisms based on sensory feedback and adaptive neural
	forward models with efference copies. This neural closed-loop controller
	enables a walking machine to perform a multitude of different walking
	patterns including insect-like leg movements and gaits as well as
	energy-efficient locomotion. In addition, the forward models allow
	the machine to autonomously adapt its locomotion to deal with a change
	of terrain, losing of ground contact during stance phase, stepping
	on or hitting an obstacle during swing phase, leg damage, and even
	to promote cockroach-like climbing behavior. Thus, the results presented
	here show that the employed embodied neural closed-loop system can
	be a powerful way for developing robust and adaptable machines.},
