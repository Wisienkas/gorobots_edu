### To see how you can run this project on Abacus, see the README_lpz_abacus file in the ABACUS dir of the legwheelbot project.
### To see what this program does you can look at the legwheelbot_project_report.pdf from the project dir.
### This file will explain how you can run this program

1)
Compile the project simply by running make in the project directory. 
Be sure to use the make file included in this project as it is different from the standard one used in gorobots.
It uses the mpic++ compiler so if you get any errors related to compilation make sure you have the necessary software to compile mpi applications installed.


2)
To just make a quick testrun you can run the compiled executable 'sim' without parameters.
Be sure you cd to the project directory first, otherwise the program will fail because it cannot find some relative paths on disk.


3)	
To run an evolution of the robot morphology you must run the program with mpi: Example

		$ mpirun -np 2 sim -simtime 1 -popsize 10 -ngen 20 -terrains rock-grass-ice -nographics

The -np parameter specifies the number of processes that will be spawned, in this case 2. 
This means that two individuals will be evaluated concurently during evolution. 
Additionally each individual being evaluated will be simultaniously evaluated in all specified terrains.
Thus in above case where 3 terrains are specified we will have 2 * 3 = 6 concurrent simmulations running.
Idealy you should choose theese parameters such that the number of concurrent simmulations matches the number of cores on your machine.


4)
Following parameters can be specified to the program. 
All parameters given are passed on to the lpz robots simulator, so you can specify any of the things available in lpzrobots and it will be passed on.
	-ngen		<How many generations do you want the evolution to run for : default 10>
	-popsize 	<The size of the population : default 10>
	-pmut		<The genome mutation probability between 0 and 1 : default 0.05>
	-pcross		<The genome crossover probability between 0 and 1 : default 0.65>
	-simtime	<For how long should the simmulation last in minutes each time a genome is evaluated. Must be positive integer greater than 1>
	-r		<Random seed. This seed is used both by lpz robots and the genetic algorithm : default 1234>
	-terrains	<A dash seperated list of terrains in which to evaluate each individual. Eg. grass-rock-sand. Look in terrainGenerator.cpp to see all terrains>
	-nographics	<When this parameter is specified all simmulations are run full speed without graphics. You probably want this when running long evolutions>


5)
During evolution results are written to csv files in a subfolder named results_legwheelbot.
Each time you run the program these files will be overwritten, so make sure to take a copy when you need the results.
You can kill the program at any point and use the results obtained so far to whatever generation was reached.
Each process outputs results to its own file, so to have the full data of the evolution you need to merge theese. In R this can be done with the following code:

DATA_DIR = "path/to/results_legwheelbot"
data = data.frame()
for(file in list.files(DATA_DIR, pattern = "*.csv", full.names = T)) {
  data = rbind(data, read.csv(file))
}
